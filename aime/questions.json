  "question": "Every morning Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks s + 2 kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at s + 1/2 kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop.",

  "question": "Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of n tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either 1 token or 4 tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.",

  "question": "Jen enters a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from S = {1, 2, 3, ..., 9, 10}. 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were 2 of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is m/n where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. Find m + n.",
